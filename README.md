# URL Shortener

This basic web application provides a web client to shorten urls, simply provide it a url and you will get a unique token that represents the provided url.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). 

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.


## Notes
- When entering a url, use the full url format include protocol and host at least.
- Works with ports, paths, queries, etc.
